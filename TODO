    * BUG: deassembled instructions are broken on mirrored PRG NROM. $8000 should be equal to $C000 but
           an instruction is decoded over the edge.

    * create a nametable viewer
    * font color and font size should not be static
    * rework window framework. make stuff toggleable and scrollable. tab through different windows.
